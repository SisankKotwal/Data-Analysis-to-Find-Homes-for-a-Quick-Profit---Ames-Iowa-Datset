# Data Analysis to Find Homes for a Quick Profit - Ames Iowa Datset

An ROI of 318.53% was achieved from the initial investment of $3.40M to capture $14.23M of profit without the need for any additional funding. My model allowed me to identify undervalued homes and build a strategy to achieve the above KPIs.

Python and Power BI were used to conduct data analysis to predict home prices by developing an ordinary least squares regression model (multiple linear regression model) on the famous Ames, Iowa dataset and create impactful visualizations to help strengthen the story behind my results.
